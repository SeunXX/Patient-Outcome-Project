# Patient-Reported-Outcome-Project

About:
Sometimes in the month of September 2018, the largest Hackathon event in Europe took place in the northern city of Germany called Kiel. I participated and worked on a project sponsored by one of the top pharmaceutical companies.

Scope & Aim:
To capture patients’ experience outcomes in clinical research or clinical practice, health authorities like FDA requires the assessment of patients’ experience.
Up till now, the classical patient-reported outcome use in these instances require much investment and efforts to develop. Moreover, the new generation of PRO promises the possibility of short and more precise measures.
This hackathon challenge is intended at developing a tool that would be useful in optimising questionnaires supporting the selection of questions from larger question pools based on the experience reported by the patient. Thos objective has to be delivered within 24 hours.
